## 1. Features

### 1. Pages are automaticly added to the navbar

- if a page (.js) or a directory with pages is added under the project's "**/pages/about**", "**/pages/certificates**", "**/pages/notes**", "**/pages/projects**", "**/pages/apps**" directory, then it will be automatically added to the "website's navbar" as a working link
- project-directories are shown as link-folders in the navbar
- images in the project's "**/public/icons/**" directory with the same **name** as the directories, are added as icon to the link-folder in the website's navbar

_see [auto-page-navbar](./assets/documentation/auto-page-navbar.md) documentation for more details_
